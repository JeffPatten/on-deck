Could have tags and then use those tags as sections or bookmarks for recipes with that tag. Cookbooks will be accesible from the kitchen dashboard. You can add a recipe to an event/course from the cook book (ie, 'add to event' button that has a modal listing the events you can add it to, then select the event and it will update that event with the recipe)
